    <p><i>One of my favorite breakfast hacks for busy mornings or breakfast meal prep.</i></p>
    <p>The buttermilk makes these baked pancakes light, fluffy, and oh-so-delicious!<br> This sheet pan pancake recipe can be easily customized by adding your favorite fruit or other pancake<br> toppings on top of the batter before cooking.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients <i>per 6 servings</i></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>3 cups baking mix</li>
        <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>¼ cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a large sheet pan or jelly roll pan with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Combine baking mix, buttermilk, eggs, sugar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon in a large mixing bowl. Mix until the ingredients are well combined, but don't overmix. Pour batter onto the parchment paper-lined pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, 15 to 18 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove sheet pan from the oven. Lift the parchment paper with the pancake from the pan and set it onto a cutting board. Slice the pancake sheet into squares using a pizza cutter or into your desired shapes with a cookie cutter.</li>
